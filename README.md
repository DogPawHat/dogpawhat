## Hi, I'm Ciar√°n 

(It's pronounced KEER-awn)

I'm a Software Developer with over 8 years of experience. I've mostly worked with React and Typescript. I have 2 cats and do bouldering and board games in my free time. I chill in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm looking for my next role to work on great projects and sound people. Reach out if you think you have something interesting.

## Skills I know pretty well
- Typescript
- React
- Tanstack Query/Router/Start
- Next.js
- Node.js
- Playwright
- Vite/Vitest
- SQL
- Can still write a Webpack config if you REALLY need one

## Skills I'm learning/tinkered with
- AI Agents
- Python
- Rust
- [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)
- Ruby on Rails

## Previous Companies
- Apata
- Evervault
- Web Summit
- Singlepoint Solutions (now Version 1)

## Intresting projects I've worked on
- "Oh s***, the conference has been cancelled because of the pandemic, we need to run a virtual live streaming site to tide us over"
- Took the UI of Evalite, an AI evals tool by Matt Pocock, and converted it from Remix to Tanstack Start
- XState is cool, but data fetching is better in Tanstack Query. Converted a whole data fetching layer from XState to Query.
- Spending too much time answering peoples questions on the Tanstack Discord
- Small contributions to Query, tanstack.com, tRPC, etc. Even have a rust-lang pr completed as well. 

## Editor of choice
Cursor, previosly VS Code

## OS of choice
MacOS or Arch Linux
